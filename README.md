# DEPRECATED: cloudcreativity/json-api

This package has been deprecated and is no longer supported. It was originally built as a framework agnostic
extension of the [neomerx/json-api](https://github.com/neomerx/json-api) package. We built it in a framework
agnostic way as we were using it in both Laravel and Zend 2 at the time. However, we now only use it in 
Laravel and have therefore deprecated this package to focus on our Laravel package.

If you need to use JSON API in a Laravel application, check out our 
[cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api) package.
